# electron-forge-react
 
A template for an Electron + React app with `electron-forge` and `react-hot-loader`. This is here to make it easier for me later because this was disgusting to set up and I'd never want to do that again to myself. Thanks, aegooby. You're welcome, aegooby. Okay to run it

    npm install
    npm start
